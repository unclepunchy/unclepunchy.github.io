          <h3 class="post-title">Learning how to code</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>My first kid was born a week into the COVID-19 shutdown.
            It was an exciting and scary time. I had a lot to learn about taking
            care of a baby, and the added stress of living through a global
            pandemic was not helpful. One nice thing was that the baby preferred
            to sleep laying on my chest for the first few months of her life. I
            think it was comforting for both of us, and I feel fortunate to have
            built a strong bond with my daughter. At the same time, it was a bit
            of an endurance game. I spent hours sitting as still and quietly as
            I could while she snoozed on my chest. I've never been great at
            being idle, so enevitably my mind would wander.
            </p>
            <p>TV, podcasts, and audiobooks are all awesome, but eventually I
            felt like I needed to do something more productive. Making things
            has always been a huge part of my life, and being away from work for
            so long was really hard. I needed something I could do with a baby
            sleeping on my chest. That's when I started looking for apps that
            I could use to teach myself how to code. I came across
            <a href="https://getmimo.com/" target="_blank">Mimo</a> and I got
            hoooked. I've also been learning on
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code
            Camp</a> and playing around with <a href="https://atom.io/"
            target="_blank">Atom</a>. I think these resources have been pretty
            helpful. I can learn and practice on my phone with Mimo, and get a
            little more in depth on my computer with Free Code Camp and Atom.
            I'm starting out with HTML and CSS. I'll move on to JavaScript next.
            I'm really enjoying it. I think there's a lot of connection for me
            between coding and being a craftperson who works with his hands. I
            love making things just right and the process it takes to get there.
            Now, I have ambitions of eventually playing around with Linux and
            Python using a Raspberry Pi. I'm also really excited about being
            able to get my daughter involved with technology when she's older.
            Who knows? Maybe I'll even be able to make some money at this
            eventually.

          <h4>My story</h4>
          <p>Hi! I'm Joshua Crotty. I'm a Michigander currently living in the
            Maryland suburbs of D.C. I work as a hand bookbinder. When I'm not
            at work I enjoy spending time with my family, fishing, hiking,
            Sci-Fi movies, videogames, and playing guitar. I've been
            learning to code as a way to pass the time during the COVID-19
            pandemic.</p>
